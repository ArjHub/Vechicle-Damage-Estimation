## Introduction

This project aims to build a VGG16 model for car damage detection, which can assist insurance companies in faster processing of claims and lenders in underwriting car loans, especially for used cars. By using computer vision techniques, the model can analyze uploaded images of damaged cars and estimate the area of damage along with an approximate cost for repair.

## Project Overview

Nowadays, the car insurance business faces a significant financial burden due to claims leakage, where the actual payment for claims differs from the amount that should have been paid if best practices were followed. Visual examination and manual assessment of damages lead to processing delays and increased costs. To tackle these issues, we propose a deep learning-based solution using the VGG16 architecture.

## Installation

To set up and run the project locallyby cloning it:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-damage-detection.git
```

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can use the car damage detection model via a user-friendly web interface. To run the web application, execute the following command:

```
python main.py
```

This will start the application, and you can access it by visiting `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## Dataset

To train and evaluate the model, we used a custom dataset comprising images of damaged cars with corresponding annotations (bounding boxes or segmentation masks) indicating the area of damage and its severity.

Please note that the dataset used for this project is not publicly available, but you can use a similar dataset or collect your own data for training.

## Model Architecture

The VGG16 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The pre-trained VGG16 model is used as the base architecture and fine-tuned on our custom car damage dataset to enable damage detection.

## Results

The performance of the car damage detection model was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results show promising performance in detecting and estimating the area of damage in car images.
